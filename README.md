# datascience_final_project

This is our final project of Data Science!

Phthalate exists extensively in plastic products such as plastic wrap and plastic bottles. In recent years, associations between it  and various disease outcomes have been discovered. Obesity is one of the major public health problems and is also associated with exposure to phthalate. 

Our team tried to find out factors that are associated with phthalate exposure by comparing urine phthalate level among different groups of people. Furthermore, we assessed relationship between phthalate exposure and obesity, adjusting for race and stratifying for gender and age.
