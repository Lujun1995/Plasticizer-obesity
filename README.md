# Analysis of plasticizer exposure patterns and effects of plasticizer on obesity

## Overview

Phthalate exists extensively in plastic products such as plastic wrap and plastic bottles. In recent years, associations between it  and various disease outcomes have been discovered. Obesity is one of the major public health problems and is also associated with exposure to phthalate. 

Our team tried to find out factors that are associated with phthalate exposure by comparing urine phthalate level among different groups of people. Furthermore, we assessed relationship between phthalate exposure and obesity, adjusting for race and stratifying for gender and age. 

## Motivation

Plasticizers, mainly phthalates, can interrupt endocrine system even if at very low level of exposure, and there is evidence of plasticizers depositing in animal brain. Concerns have been rising in pediatricians and scientists. Obesity, which is a major public health problem across the world, is also associated with plasticizer exposure. First fat and now sugar have been blamed for causing obesity, while increasing evidence shows that plasticizer pollution is also playing an important role. However, effects of plasticizers on bodyweight within different age and gender groups are different. With more detailed exposure monitoring data of plasticizer exposure available at NHANES datasets, we can now explore the relationship between body weight and plasticizer exposure.
