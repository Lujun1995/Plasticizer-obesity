## The tentative project title
Plasticizer and Children's Health in NHANES data

## The motivation for this project
As the increasing mount of plastic products in our everyday life and food industry, plasticizers released from these products and their impacts on our health have brought up broad public concerns. Researches have suggested some small molecules can cross blood brain barrier[1], disrupt human endocrine system and neurological system even at extremely low level of exposure [2]. With the ubiquity of plastics a fact we will keep living with for a long time, how the plasticizers influence our health, especially the children, on which aspect and at what amount deserve special attention. NHANES data contain detailed blood and urine data of plasticizer and varies disease for several years. We want to explore this dataset and visualize the health impacts to concerning parents and children care givers, bring more direct attention and awareness to our over plasticized everyday life.

## The intended final products

## The anticipated data sources
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a biannual, nationally representative survey of the noninstitutionalized US population administered by the National Centers for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).


## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
We plan to focus on the effect of phthalates on human health. Specifically, we plan to analyze the linear relationship between urine phthalates level and BMI, and between urine phthalates level and blood pressure. When analyzing the relationships, we will try to exclude the effects of confounders that may bias the result. We plan to fit linear regression model between the two body index (BMI and blood pressure) and urine phthalates level respectively, and visualize the linear regressions. We also plan to visualize the trend of urine phthalates level change in recent years, and the distribution of urine phthalates level in different groups of people(e.g. groups by age, gender, etc).
