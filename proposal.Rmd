## The motivation for this project


## The intended final products

## The anticipated data sources
<<<<<<< HEAD
Our anticipated data source is several datasets on adolecent obesity provided by "Health data NY" website, which is an open data site maintained by the New York State Department of Health devoted to providing access to health data.[3] We also found a dataset on NYC Opendata, which provides information of each school in New York city. In total, we got the following 4 datasets: 

1. A school demographic dataset. This dataset shows information of students such as sex ratio, race ratio, etc.link: <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2018-Demographic-Snapshot-School/s52a-8aq6> 

2. A dataset containing the prevalence of obesity among students in a certain county.

3. A dataset showing location of each school.link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2017-2018-School-Locations/p6h4-mpyy

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

We plan to focus on three main problems:

1. find the tendency of the percentages of obesity and overweight in different schools over years
2. visualize the location and corresponding obesity percentage on the map 
3. find the association between obesity and other factors(sugar drinking, race, exercise and so on) among students
