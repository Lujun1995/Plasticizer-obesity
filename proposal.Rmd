## The tentative project title

## The group members (names and UNIs)

## The motivation for this project

## The intended final products

## The anticipated data sources

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
We plan to focus on the effect of phthalates on human health. Specifically, we plan to analyze the linear relationship between urine phthalates level and BMI, and between urine phthalates level and blood pressure. When analyzing the relationships, we will try to exclude the effects of confounders that may bias the result. We plan to fit linear regression model between the two body index (BMI and blood pressure) and urine phthalates level respectively, and visualize the linear regressions. We also plan to visualize the trend of urine phthalates level change in recent years, and the distribution of urine phthalates level in different groups of people(e.g. groups by age, gender, etc).
