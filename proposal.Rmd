## The motivation for this project

It has been long recognized that childhood overweight and obesity will continue to adulthood. Strongly associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental social wellbeing, obesity is among top public health concerns in the US and around the world. We found several projects monitoring weight and obesity rate in schools, along with diets and behavior data. Big efforts have been made to fight the obesity pandemic, the obesity rate in NYC school children have dropped. But is it a true drop or just demographic change? 

The genetic background play a major role in the development of obesity along with diet and lifestyle. Researches have found that asian children and adults have significantly lower obesity rate than other races by current BMI criteria (overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2))  [1], however the risk to develop type 2 diabetes has been increasing among asians around the world. Researches suggest that to evaluate risk of disease, the BMI cut-off values should be lower for asians due to higher body fat percentage and higher percentage of visceral/peripheral distribution (overweight (BMI ≥22-23 kg/m2) or obese (BMI ≥25-28 kg/m2)) [2].

Thus, we are interested in examining if current decline in NYC school student obesity rate is affected by changes in school demographic features. If the misclassification of weight status in Asian population caused under-diagnosis or delayed detection of diabetes, and the potential loss caused by this problem.

## The intended final products

In the dataset, we expect to establish a map of the obesity proportion in different schools in New York city. From over three different dataset , we can know information including the health situation of students, the scores of the school, the school’s geographical data and so on. So we are intended to utilize several plots to describe the obesity situation in students in schools:

First, we plan to build a shinny map to better describe the geographical distribution of the schools and their obesity proportion. Since we also have the detailed information about the students’ race, family status, sex and other factors, we can also make a plot about association of students obesity situation and the school meals, getting rid of the confounder like sex, race and age. Furthermore, there may be other connection between students’ obesity situation and school scores or the community over different years. All the visualization will be made in R.

As is written above, we are intended to provide a product with diverse plots describing the over three dataset visually, and then build a website to present our results of exploring the data. According to the requirements, we will also submit our reports about the project. Hope finally we can present a clear and logic product to interpret our results of the project.


## The anticipated data sources
Our anticipated data source is several datasets on adolecent obesity provided by "Health data NY" website, which is an open data site maintained by the New York State Department of Health devoted to providing access to health data.[3] We also found a dataset on NYC Opendata, which provides information of each school in New York city. In total, we got the following 4 datasets: 

1. A school demographic dataset. This dataset shows information of students such as sex ratio, race ratio, etc.link: <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2018-Demographic-Snapshot-School/s52a-8aq6> 

2. A dataset containing the prevalence of obesity among students in a certain county.

3. A dataset showing location of each school.link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2017-2018-School-Locations/p6h4-mpyy

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

We plan to focus on three main problems:

1. find the tendency of the percentages of obesity and overweight in different schools over years with adjustification of race
2. visualize the location and corresponding obesity percentage on the map 
3. find the association between obesity and other factors(sugar drinks, exercise and so on) among students
