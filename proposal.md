The motivation for this project
-------------------------------

Children who are obese are more likely to be unhealthy, either physically or mentally or both. Moreover, childhood obesity is related to increased risk for adult obesity and adult obesity is also associated with increased risk of a number of serious health conditions including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Thus, we are interested in the topic of childhood obesity and try to explore risk factors of childhood obesity. Studies have found that prevalence of childhood obesity differs among different race groups. And where people live can affect their ability to make healthy choices, which also implies that prevalence of obesity can be influenced by a personâ€™s community.

The intended final products

The anticipated data sources
----------------------------

Our anticipated data source is several datasets on adolecent obesity provided by "Health data NY" website, which is an open data site maintained by the New York State Department of Health devoted to providing access to health data.\[3\] We also found a dataset on NYC Opendata, which provides information of each school in New York city. In total, we got the following 4 datasets:

1.  A school demographic dataset. This dataset shows information of students such as sex ratio, race ratio, etc.link: <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2018-Demographic-Snapshot-School/s52a-8aq6>

2.  A dataset containing the prevalence of obesity among students in a certain county.

3.  A dataset showing location of each school.link: <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2017-2018-School-Locations/p6h4-mpyy>

The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

We plan to focus on three main problems:

1.  find the tendency of the percentages of obesity and overweight in different schools over years
2.  visualize the location and corresponding obesity percentage on the map
3.  find the association between obesity and other factors(sugar drinking, race, exercise and so on) among students
