The motivation for this project
-------------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
As the increasing mount of plastic products in our everyday life and food industry, plasticizers released from these products and their impacts on our health have brought up broad public concerns. Researches have suggested some small molecules can disrupt human endocrine system and neurological system even at extremely low level of exposure \[1\*\]. With the ubiquity of plastics a fact we will keep living with for a long time, how the plasticizers influence our health, especially the children, on which aspect and at what amount deserve special attention. NHANES data contain detailed blood and urine data of plasticizer and varies disease for several years. We want to explore this dataset and visualize the health impacts to concerning parents and children care givers, bring more direct attention and awareness to our over plasticized everyday life. 1\* : <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3365860/>

The intended final products
---------------------------

The anticipated data sources
----------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a biannual, nationally representative survey of the noninstitutionalized US population administered by the National Centers for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
=======
Our anticipated data source is several datasets on adolecent obesity provided by "Health data NY" website, which is an open data site maintained by the New York State Department of Health devoted to providing access to health data.[3](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/statistics_and_impact/student_weight_status_data.htm) We also found a dataset on NYC Opendata, which provides information of each school in New York city. In total, we got the following 4 datasets: 1. A dataset containing information on each school. This dataset shows sex ratio, race ratio, etc.link: <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2018-Demographic-Snapshot-School/s52a-8aq6> 2. A dataset containing the prevalence of obesity among students in a certain county. The data is available for several years.

The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
We plan to focus on three main problems:

1.  find the tendency of the percentages of obesity and overweight in different schools over years
2.  visualize the location and corresponding obesity percentage on the map
3.  find the association between obesity and other factors(sugar drinking, race, exercise and so on) among students
